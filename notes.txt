 Example Folder Structure

Here’s an example of how you might organize these pages within your application’s folder structure:

```
/school_app
    /public
        index.php
    /src
        /App
            /Controllers
                DashboardController.php
                ProfileController.php
                AcademicController.php
                ScheduleController.php
                AssignmentsController.php
                GradesController.php
                LeavesController.php
                NotificationsController.php
                AuthController.php
            /Services
                UserService.php
                AssignmentService.php
                GradeService.php
                LeaveService.php
            /Views
                /dashboard
                    index.php
                /profile
                    index.php
                /academic
                    index.php
                /schedule
                    index.php
                /assignments
                    index.php
                /grades
                    index.php
                /leaves
                    index.php
                /notifications
                    index.php
                /auth
                    login.php
                    register.php
    /vendor
        /firebase
            /php-jwt
```

 Steps to Implement

1.   Controllers  : Each controller handles the business logic for a specific section of the application.
    - Example: `ProfileController.php` manages user profile-related actions.

2.   Views  : Each view corresponds to a page in your application.
    - Example: `profile/index.php` renders the profile page.

3.   Services  : Services contain the logic for interacting with the database.
    - Example: `UserService.php` contains methods to retrieve and update user data.

 Example Controller: `ProfileController.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use App\Services\UserService;

class ProfileController
{
    protected $userService;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->userService = new UserService();
    }

    public function index()
    {
        // Assuming you have a way to get the currently logged-in student
        $studentId = $_SESSION['student_id'];
        $student = $this->userService->getStudentById($studentId);

        // Render the profile view with student data
        include '../Views/profile/index.php';
    }

    public function update($formData)
    {
        $studentId = $_SESSION['student_id'];
        $this->userService->updateStudent($studentId, $formData);

        // Redirect back to the profile page
        header('Location: /profile');
    }
}
```

 Example View: `profile/index.php`
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Profile</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <form action="/profile/update" method="post">
        <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name" value="<?= $student['first_name'] ?>" required>
        <br>
        <label for="last_name">Last Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="last_name" name="last_name" value="<?= $student['last_name'] ?>" required>
        <br>
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" value="<?= $student['email'] ?>" required>
        <br>
        <label for="phone">Phone:</label>
        <input type="text" id="phone" name="phone" value="<?= $student['phone'] ?>" required>
        <br>
        <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

 Example Service: `UserService.php`
```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use PDO;

class UserService
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=school_app', 'root', '');
    }

    public function getStudentById($id)
    {
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare('SELECT   FROM STUDENT WHERE id = :id');
        $stmt->execute(['id' => $id]);
        return $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }

    public function updateStudent($id, $data)
    {
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare('UPDATE STUDENT SET first_name = :first_name, last_name = :last_name, email = :email, phone = :phone WHERE id = :id');
        $stmt->execute([
            'id' => $id,
            'first_name' => $data['first_name'],
            'last_name' => $data['last_name'],
            'email' => $data['email'],
            'phone' => $data['phone']
        ]);
    }
}
```

This setup provides a robust structure for your school application, ensuring that the student can access various functionalities efficiently.
